\chapter{Reconstruction} % 

The precise measurement of particles produced in the high energy collisions at the LHC 
is necessary to effectively execute the CMS physics programme. This requires effective
reconstruction and identification of physics objects in a challenging environment containing
large numbers of different particles with a range of energies. The \alphat analysis 
relies directly on reconstruction of jets and \met for the signal region and on the 
reconstruction of leptons and photons to reject backgrounds and define control regions.
This requires the use of information from all detector subsystems and state-of-the-art
techniques for reconstruction, selection and calibration of physics objects to ensure 
an optimal performance.
